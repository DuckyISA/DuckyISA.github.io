## Tools

Tools customized for development with **DuckyISA** are forked from their upstream repositories. Forks are not continuously synced with their origins, such action requires rebasing **DuckyISA** patches and often involves examination of upstream changelogs since the last sync. That usualy happens when interesting or major changes hit upstream, and when it's a good idea to pull them to **DuckyISA** downstream.

Versions of **DuckyISA** tools follows the upstream versioning schemes, reflecting the last sync with the upstream repository at the moment **DuckyISA** patches were applied.
