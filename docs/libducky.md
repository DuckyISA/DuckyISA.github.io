**libducky** is a "C standard library"-like library, providing common functions and macros one would expect from a C standard library, but intended for use for development of applications for **DuckyISA** boards.

> **libducky** is far from providing complete C standard library API developers can experience with GNU libc or Newlib. It contains functions and macros needed for the latest experiments with **DuckyISA** boards and the toolchain, and API is extended when I miss something.
