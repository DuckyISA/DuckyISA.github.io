## This documentation is still Work In Progress!

> I'm putting together pieces of docs split between separate project, I'm clearing up specifications, I'm trying to formalize and record commands I have in my Bash history. Large parts are missing, some pages contains just few randomly looking paragraphs... Still messy. Working on that.

`Ducky` is a toy instruction set architecture (``ISA``) based on RISC principles. Despite being developed in a spare time, it comes with:

 * an [emulator](qemu.md),
 * a HW board [proposal](mallard.md),
 * the complete development [toolchain](toolchain.md),
 * a "system" [library](libducky.md),
 * a set of examples,
 * and a (more or less :) complete documentation.
